# Portfolio Analysis Dashboard

This project is a web application built using Dash that allows users to analyze a mock investment portfolio consisting of popular stocks. The application visualizes stock prices and the overall return of the portfolio over a specified date range.

## Features

- **Interactive Stock Price Visualization**: Users can select a stock ticker from a dropdown menu to view its price trend over time.
- **Portfolio Return Calculation**: The app computes and displays the overall return of a weighted portfolio, allowing users to see how their investments perform.
- **Date Range Selector**: Users can filter the data by choosing a specific date range to focus on.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data manipulation and application logic.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and random data generation.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Dash**: For building the web application and enabling interactivity.
